# datasci-studio

A collection of miscellaneous projects involving analyzing data and other
related things.

More of a showcase than a product, so, issues and PRs are welcome, but unless
they're corrections or additions to my learning, I probably won't do much with
them.

If you find anything in here useful, feel free to check out my [other
projects](https://github.com/ThatNerdSquared?tab=repositories). Or hack on some
of this code in your own projects (credit would be great though). Also, if you
work in data science (or science in general), especially in the Vancouver,
Canada area, I'd love to talk. Feel free to open an issue and we'll get in touch
:)
