  abstract = {Catechins from green tea (Camellia sinensis L.) have received considerable attention due to their beneficial effects on human health, such as antioxidant and anticancer activities. Optimisation of extraction conditions of the catechins from green tea leaves was performed using different solvents (ethanol or distilled water), different extraction methods (ultrasound-assisted, room temperature or reflux extractions) and various extraction times (0.5–24 h). The optimal extraction conditions were determined using 40\% ethanol with ultrasound-assisted extraction method for 2 h at 40 °C. In addition, two isolation methods for the recovery of catechins from green tea extracts were compared using different solvent combinations (chloroform/ethyl acetate versus ethyl acetate/dichloromethane). The results showed that the ethyl acetate/dichloromethane system could achieve much higher content of catechins than the other isolation approaches, indicating the method that extract catechins first with organic solvent such as ethyl acetate before removing caffeine is much effective than removing caffeine first when organic solvents are used for the recovery of catechins without caffeine from green tea extracts.},
